                    <p>The Anantha Padmanabhaswamy Temple is a renowned Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, it is one of the 108 Divya Desams, which are the holiest abodes of Vishnu as per Vaishnavism. The temple's deity, Padmanabhaswamy, is depicted in a unique posture, reclining on the serpent Anantha (also known as Adishesha), symbolizing eternal sleep.</p>
                    <p>The Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Kerala is believed to have many mysteries, including a hidden chamber that some say shouldn't be opened: Vault B. Also known as Bharatakkon Kallara, this chamber is believed to be the most connected to the god Padmanabhaswamy. Some say the chamber is guarded by supernatural beings, including serpents, a mythical vampire, and others. The door to the chamber has imagery of serpents and yakshis to indicate danger to anyone who tries to open it. Some say that opening the chamber would cause the region to flood because it's connected to the Arabian Sea. Others believe that opening the chamber would unleash catastrophes across the state and in Kerala.</p>
                    <p>Sadhus and the Garuda Mantra: Some say that only sadhus who can chant the "Garuda Mantra" can open the chamber. However, no sadhus in India are said to be able to chant the mantra.</p>
                    <p>Man-made techniques: Many temple officials and Hindu mythological experts believe that opening the chamber using modern technology would lead to major catastrophes.</p>

                    <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anantha Padmanabhaswamy Temple is often referred to as the richest temple in the world. In 2011, a secret underground chamber (referred to as "Vault B") was discovered, containing treasures worth billions of dollars, including gold, jewels, and artifacts.</li>
                        <li>Vault B is one of the six secret vaults in the temple and is said to be guarded by supernatural forces. It remains unopened, as local legends suggest opening it would bring dire consequences.</li>
                        <li>The temple's architecture is a masterpiece, with its massive gopuram (tower) standing at around 100 feet tall. The temple's interiors are adorned with exquisite murals and stone carvings, showcasing the artistic heritage of the region.</li>
                        <li>The temple has a history that dates back to the 6th century CE. However, the present structure was expanded and renovated in the 18th century by the Travancore royal family, who continue to be the custodians of the temple.</li>
                        <li>The main idol of Lord Vishnu in the temple is in a reclining posture, measuring about 18 feet long. The deity is visible through three different doors in the sanctum sanctorum, with the head, body, and feet visible separately through each door.</li>
                        <li>The temple has a strict dress code for devotees. Men are required to wear a "mundu" (a traditional white cloth) without a shirt, while women must wear a sari or a traditional long skirt and blouse.</li>
                        <li>According to legend, the temple was built by Sage Divakara Muni Vilwamangalam, who was visited by Lord Vishnu in the form of a small boy. The boy later disappeared into a tree, and when the sage searched for him, the tree fell, revealing the idol of Lord Vishnu in the Anantha Shayana (reclining) posture.</li>
